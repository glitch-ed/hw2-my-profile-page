            Hey there!  My name is Eddie Villarreal and I am studying to be a web developer.  
            Originally from Laredo, Texas, I moved to San Antonio in 2001 and have been here ever since.  
            As an undergrad at UTSA I studied technology but soon fell into an operations management position for a medical
             organization and realized I was rather good at it.  Throughout my 15-year career in health and wellness management 
             I was still dabbling in the tech field here and there and was usually the go-to person for most of the software 
             upgrades and new software integration projects at my company.  Finally, my love for tech boiled over and realized 
             I wanted to make a career change.  I decided to take the leap and enrolled in the UTSA Coding Bootcamp.  
             So far, I am finding the projects and classes fun and intriguing.   I am hoping to learn and improve my skills 
             over the course of the program to build a portfolio to impress prospective employers and learn the skills necessary 
             to be a full stack developer.  I am confident in achieving my goals because I know I can be good at this.  
             So far, the decision to change career paths and pursue web development has been fun, exciting, terrifying and I am 
             grateful I did it because sometimes you have to just take a deep breath and jump.
