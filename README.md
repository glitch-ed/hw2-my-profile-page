About me page created with Boot Strap with contacts and portfolio


I created a site for my porfolio from scratch.  

linked bootstarp and a css page to it as well as working links to 3 seprate HTML files.

Used alt tags, sementic tags.

I ust bootstrap grids, and a tiny bit of media queries. 

I enjoyed it because it really let me knew practice with details such as the padding and borders around images.  

I already enjoyed working with bootstrap
